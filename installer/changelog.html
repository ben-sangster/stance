<h2>Version 1.0.2 (2011-06-16)</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Players can now view the status of active votes that they have already voted on by clicking on the vote box. Votes cannot be changed once made, however, and this view only displays information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Moved the admin-only group-switching tool from the main window to the edit scenario window.</li>
   <li>Changed the time labels of the voting history list to more clearly describe the information in the start and end fields.</li>
   <li>Decreased the size of several text fields in the advisor window.</li>
   <li>Removed the "Report a Problem" option from the in-game help email. All issues should be discussed on the class forums or emailed directly to "techsupport@chds.us" .</li>
   <li>Changed format of app title bar to include the name of user's current group.</li>
   <li>Added the advisor name and title to the admin vote approval dialog.</li>
   <li>Added the advisor name to the user voting dialog.</li>
   <li>All dialog windows will now appear attached to their parent window, rather than free floating.</li>
   <li>In order to prevent data errors for game objects (questions, tasks) where only one is allowed at a time, users who did not successfully connect to the server can no longer vote, submit questions, or submit tasks.</li>
   <li>Admins must now have an active server connection to approve tasks or answer questions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Fixed a bug where archived data from one database could be transferred to another.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug where long answers to questions in the advisor window would be unreadable. These answers should now be scroll windows.</li>
   <li>Adjusted the location of several notification icons that were hidden by other images.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug where the admin window could display a group's office without being properly linked to that group.</li>
   <li>New tasks should now immediately appear in the vote history window when submitted.</li>
   <li>Admins should now properly receive notifications about new media injects.</li>
   <li>Fixed an edge case where updates for one group could cause notifications to appear for another.</li>
</ul>
