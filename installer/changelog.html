<h2>Version 1.1.0 (2011-08-16)</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Video window now plays flash videos hosted on remote sites.</li>
   <li>When creating new users, admins now have the option to make the new user an admin.</li>
   <li>Advisor window overhaul.</li>
   <li>Vote window now contains a history of previous votes.</li>
   <li>Windows now appear over the office, rather than as entirely new screens.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Modified method of updating notifications for forums.</li>
   <li>Lobbyist history is now saved, users can view previous messages from lobbyists just like with memos, newspapers and videos.</li>
   <li>Lobbyist bio was removed.</li>
   <li>Major data structure rewrite in order to reduce the number of database writes necessary for new actions.</li>
   <li>Game time removed.</li>
   <li>All objects which require a timestamp now receive their timestamp from the server in order to provide proper synchronization. Any of these objects created while not logged in will not receive a timestamp until reaching the server for the first time.<li>
   <li>Removed the "Time" tab from the admin Edit Scenario window. The Start/End game button now sends out emails to students and sets flags for the server to set an appropriate start or end time for AAR graphs.</li>
   <li>Removed desk calendar.</li>
   <li>Advisor windows no longer show vote history, only a widget for submitting votes.</li>   
   <li>The vote window has been rewritten to allow for simpler use. It also now contains a full history of a group's votes in reverse chronological order.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Adjusted the locations of many notification icons in order to bring them more in line with actual image locations on screen.</li>
   <li>Map code has been greatly simplified. As a consequence, though, it will only update when the map is opened -- any updates received while the map is open will not be shown until the next time that the window is opened.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.3 (2011-07-07)</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
   <li>After Action Report Utility added to allow admins an easy method of reviewing simulation statistics and timelines.</li>
   <li>OS X install process has gotten an update to increase ease of use. Installation can now be accomplished simply by dragging the STANCE icon over to the Applications directory shortcut that pops up next to it.</li>
   <li>Added "Preferences" to app to allow for multiple update channels. Students are recommended to stay with the (default) "stable" updates, but the curious can try the "devel" updates, which can have faster fixes for previous bugs, but may contain additional new bugs. Please do not use the "test" option unless specifically instructed to do so.</li>
   <li>Added link checker to admin window to ensure that inject links are associated with the proper type of inject.</li>

   <li>Added ability for admin to enable / disable Lobbyist, Video, Memo, and Newspaper injects that are not functioning correctly.</li>
   <li>Added an option to the "File" menu which will let students clear their local STANCE data cache. This *only* clears game data, and does *not* require any sort of reinstall. All data will be redownloaded the next time that the user logs in to the game. This can fix some bugs with not being able to post, or seeing advisors locked when they should not be.</li>
   <li>Users will now receive an email when their group completes a vote.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>

   <li>Removed the gray border around the game window.</li>

   <li>Modified subject line of admin vote emails to allow for inbox filtering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Lobbyist notifications should now work as intended.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug where vote real end dates would show up as "undefined" until reviewed by advisor. This should now read "N/A".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.2 (2011-06-16)</h2>

   <li>Added the advisor name and title to the admin vote approval dialog.</li>

   <li>Admins must now have an active server connection to approve tasks or answer questions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Fixed a bug where archived data from one database could be transferred to another.</li>

   <li>New tasks should now immediately appear in the vote history window when submitted.</li>
