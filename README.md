In one Sentence
============
This game is a Game-Based Exploration of the process for strategic thinking required to develop policies.

Objective
=======
The learning objective will be to familiarize students with the conflictive nature of the strategic policy process using a simulated environment to expose them to the inherent characteristics of the adaptive environments where they are supposed to be agents of change.  
This game will create a scenario (or a series of scenarios) where the students will learn very practical insights about how to think strategically when pushing for policy modification. 
We will take advantage of the innate complexities of border management issues to use border security as our case study to frame the strategic process, forcing the students into the different roles of some of the most important stakeholders. We will then introduce a disruption where change will become unavoidable. By doing this, we will be creating “strategic memory reflexes” that will help them later to recognize other situations where strategic thinking is necessary. In the same way a pilot learns in a simulator how to react when different events happen, our students will “learn by doing” in a safe and inconsequential environment how to become adaptive strategists and agents of change.
